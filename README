Before this can run u need to import the data to be guessed on

Also generate this file:
/config/api_keys.txt and put just the api key in it

To set up, run:

rake populate:setup

2. Description/How it works

A python script downloads 1000 recent comments from the NYTimes using the NYTimes comments API.  The comments' bodies are parsed and submitted to Parsely which identifies entities, then the entities are counted.  Relevant entities (count >= 3 and length of name >= 4 to avoid abbreviations ) are then used to find all pictures on Tumblr tags with the same tag as that entity and the urls of those images are stored on the database.  When the front page is loaded (the game is started), a topic is chosen from the database at random which has at least 5 image urls associated to it.  The game logic is written mostly in javascript, and the user must guess the associated topic with each image, having 5 total guesses.
